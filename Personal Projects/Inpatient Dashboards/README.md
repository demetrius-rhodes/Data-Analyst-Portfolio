## Inpatient Dashboards
___

##### This project automates a process that was done manually using Excel and PowerPoint. Every month the data would be put into an excel spreadsheet, made into charts, and inserted into a PowerPoint for each facility. This project shows an example of connecting to the ODBC, collecting and cleaning the data, and showing the monthly data of each facility in its own dashboard. The project is the file InpatientMetrics.ipynb. The results of what the script accomplihes are in the two files Inpatient Dashboards and Inpatient Summary Dashboards.
