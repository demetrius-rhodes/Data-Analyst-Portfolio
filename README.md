# Data-Analytics-Projects
___

#### This repository is mainly for projects I have done using DataQuest and also projects I have done outside of the course.

#### DataQuest offers online, 24-week project-based data science courses focused on data analysis using R and Python, and SQL. Dataquest's unique hands-on approach teaches data science using interactive coding challenges and projects. It helps by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I have developed proficiency in Python, SQL, Python's data analytic libraries (Numpy & Pandas), and Python's visulization libraries (Seaborn & MatPlotlib). I even branched out and learned another visulization library, Plotly. I used Plotly for one of the projects that is in this repository. 

The Dataquest projects are under the **DataQuest** folder and the personal project are under the **Personal Projects** folder.
