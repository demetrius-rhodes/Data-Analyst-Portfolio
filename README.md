# Data-Analytics-Projects
___

#### This repository is mainly for projects I have done using DataQuest and also projects I have done outside of the couse.

#### DataQuest offers online, 24-week project-based data science courses focused on data analysis using R and Python, and SQL. Dataquest's unique hands-on approach teaches data science using interactive coding challenges and projects. I am developing proficiency in Python and SQL, Python's data analytic libraries (Numpy & Pandas), and Python's visulization libraries (Seaborn & MatPlotlib). I even branched out and learned another visulization library Plotly, which I used for one of the projects that will be in this repository.

Two data sets were given. The first data set contained approximetly 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. The second data set contained approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. The goal of the project was to help developers figure out which applications attract more users.
