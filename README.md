# Data-Analytics-Projects
___

#### This repository is mainly for projects I have done using DataQuest and also projects I have done outside of the couse.

#### DataQuest offers online, 24-week project-based data science courses focused on data analysis using R and Python, and SQL. Dataquest's unique hands-on approach teaches data science using interactive coding challenges and projects. I am developing proficiency in Python and SQL, Python's data analytic libraries (Numpy & Pandas), and Python's visulization libraries (Seaborn & MatPlotlib). I even branched out and learned another visulization library Plotly, which I used for one of the projects that will be in this repository.

### Project: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
___
Two data sets were given. The first data set contained approximetly 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. The second data set contained approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. The goal of the project was to help developers figure out which applications attract more users.

### Project: Exploring Hacker News Posts
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

In this project, the two types of user-submitted stories (known as "posts") will be compared. The two posts that will be compared are the Ask HN and the Show HN posts. Ask HN post are submitted by users to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Show HN posts are submitted by user and show the Hacker News community a project, product, or generally something interesting.
