# Data-Analytics-Projects
___

#### This repository is mainly for projects I have done using DataQuest and also projects I have done outside of the couse.

#### DataQuest offers online, 24-week project-based data science courses focused on data analysis using R and Python, and SQL. Dataquest's unique hands-on approach teaches data science using interactive coding challenges and projects. I am developing proficiency in Python and SQL, Python's data analytic libraries (Numpy & Pandas), and Python's visulization libraries (Seaborn & MatPlotlib). I even branched out and learned another visulization library Plotly, which I used for one of the projects that will be in this repository.
